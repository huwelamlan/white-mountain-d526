3. Connect Your Wallet to a DEX:
   - Visit a BlackRock Digital Asset Token Presale.
   - Click on the "Connect Wallet" button and follow the prompts to connect your MetaMask or preferred DEX wallet.

   - Once your wallet is connected, navigate to the exchange interface.
   - Select the cryptocurrency you wish to swap (e.g., ETH or BNB) and enter the amount.
   - Review the transaction details, including the exchange rate and any associated fees.
   - Confirm the swap and authorize the transaction in your wallet.

5. Verify Your BRDA Tokens:
   - After the transaction is confirmed, your BRDA tokens will appear in your wallet.
   - You may need to add BRDA as a custom token in your wallet using the contract address for visibility.

6. Secure Your Investment:
   - Consider transferring your BRDA tokens to a secure hardware wallet for enhanced security.
